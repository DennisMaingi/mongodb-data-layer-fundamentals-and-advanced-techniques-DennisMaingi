#  MERN Week 1 Assignment â€” MongoDB Queries & Indexing

This project demonstrates practical MongoDB usage through basic to advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and performance optimization using indexes.

---

##  Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=16.20.1`
- MongoDB local or cloud instance
- MongoDB Compass (optional)
- Mongo Shell or MongoDB Atlas CLI

---

##  Assumed Book Document Structure

```json
{
  "title": "The Alchemist",
  "author": "Paulo Coelho",
  "genre": "Fiction",
  "yearPublished": 1988,
  "price": 15.99,
  "inStock": true
}
 Task 1: Basic Queries
Description	Query
Find all books in a specific genre	db.books.find({ genre: "Fiction" })
Find books published after 2010	db.books.find({ yearPublished: { $gt: 2010 } })
Find books by a specific author	db.books.find({ author: "J.K. Rowling" })
Update the price of a book	db.books.updateOne({ title: "The Alchemist" }, { $set: { price: 12.99 } })
Delete a book by title	db.books.deleteOne({ title: "The Alchemist" })

 Task 2: Advanced Queries
Filter + Projection
db.books.find(
  { genre: "Fiction", yearPublished: { $gt: 2010 }, inStock: true },
  { _id: 0, title: 1, author: 1, price: 1 }
);

Sorting
db.books.find().sort({ price: 1 }); // Ascending
db.books.find().sort({ price: -1 }); // Descending

Pagination (5 per page)
db.books.find().skip(0).limit(5);  // Page 1
db.books.find().skip(5).limit(5);  // Page 2

 Task 3: Aggregation Pipelines
 Average Price by Genre
db.books.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$genre", averagePrice: { $avg: "$price" }, totalBooks: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { averagePrice: -1 } }
]);

 Author With Most Books
db.books.aggregate([
  { $group: { _id: "$author", bookCount: { $sum: 1 } } },
  { $sort: { bookCount: -1 } },
  { $limit: 1 }
]);

 Group Books by Publication Decade
db.books.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      decade: {
        $concat: [
          { $toString: { $multiply: [ { $floor: { $divide: ["$yearPublished", 10] } }, 10 ] } },
          "s"
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$decade",
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  },
  { $sort: { _id: 1 } }
]);

 Task 4: Indexing & Performance
 Create Index on title
db.books.createIndex({ title: 1 });

 Create Compound Index on author + yearPublished
db.books.createIndex({ author: 1, yearPublished: 1 });

 Check Query Performance with explain()
Without Index
db.books.find({ title: "The Alchemist" }).explain("executionStats");

With Index (after creation)
db.books.find({ title: "The Alchemist" }).explain("executionStats");


Look for "stage": "IXSCAN" instead of "COLLSCAN" to confirm index usage.

 Mongoose Integration (Optional)

Use indexes in your Mongoose schema:

const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: String,
  author: String,
  genre: String,
  yearPublished: Number,
  price: Number,
  inStock: Boolean
});

bookSchema.index({ title: 1 });
bookSchema.index({ author: 1, yearPublished: 1 });

module.exports = mongoose.model("Book", bookSchema);

 Testing Tips

Use MongoDB Compass to visually analyze indexes.

Use .explain("executionStats") for benchmarking query performance.

Insert mock data with varied genres, years, and authors to simulate realistic usage.
